# PolicyNotCompliant

## Meaning

The policy is not compliant for longer than 5 minutes.

## Impact

We have some violations of the policy deployed in the hub.

Note that the impacted cluster may be wrongly reported as the ``local cluster`` due to a limitation in the current exposed metrics. The impacted clusters (so those that have a not compliant policy) can be determined by checking the following section.

## Diagnosis

To login to the ACM console and check the policy status, you can find the reason, for exampleï¼š

![](/images/policy-status.png)

You can also find the reason from the command line:

```
kubectl get policy $NS.$POLICY_NAME -n $CLUSTER_NAME -o yaml
```

## Mitigation

The resolution depends on the particular issue reported in the logs.
